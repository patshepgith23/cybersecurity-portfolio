                                                                                                                                            - Large-scale vulnerability assessments across enterprise environments
   - Development of triage and prioritization frameworks
   - Cross-functional team coordination
   - Metrics-driven vulnerability management
   - Executive reporting and communication
                                                                                                                                                                               
## Next Steps

   - Review the triage methodology to understand the decision-making process
   - Examine the SOPs for best practices in data handling and communication
   - Study the workflow documentation for end-to-end vulnerability processes
   - Analyze the assessment report metrics to see real-world vulnerability data examples
   - Consider how these methodologies apply to your organization
