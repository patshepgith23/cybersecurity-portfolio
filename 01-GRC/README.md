# Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)

## Overview

This section demonstrates expertise in security governance, risk assessment, and compliance frameworks. Projects showcase practical applications of GRC principles including policy development, risk assessment methodologies, and analysis of real-world security breaches.

## Projects & Deliverables

### 1. Security Policies

**Location:** `./TBD*-Policies/`

Comprehensive security policies developed for a sample organization to establish governance frameworks:

- **Acceptable Use Policy** - Guidelines for acceptable use of company systems, networks, and data 
- **User Access Management Policy** - Standards for granting, modifying, reviewing, and revoking user access to company systems and data
- **User Monitoring Policy** - Guidelines for monitoring user activity to detect misuse, security incidents, and policy violations 
- **Security Logging & Monitoring Policy** - Standards for security event logging, collection, and ongoing monitoring 
- **Log Retention Policy** - Requirements for the retention, storage, and secure disposal of system and security logs 
- **Audit Logging Policy** - Standards for logging audit-relevant activities to support accountability, investigations, and compliance 
- **SIEM & Alerting Policy** - Guidelines for centralized log correlation, security alerting, and incident escalation
   
    - **Key Elements:**
       - Clear policy objectives and scope
       - Roles and responsibilities
       - Implementation requirements
       - Compliance and enforcement mechanisms
       - Compliance Control Mapping (SOC II, ISO, and ISMAP)
           
### 2. Risk Assessment
           
**Location:** `./TBD*-Risk-Assessments/`
           
Risk assessment reports for hypothetical organizations demonstrating:
           
- **Asset Identification** - Inventory of organizational assets and their criticality
- **Threat Analysis** - Identification of potential threats and threat actors
- **Vulnerability Assessment** - Discovery of potential weaknesses
- **Risk Calculation** - Quantitative and qualitative risk analysis
- **Remediation Recommendations** - Prioritized mitigation strategies
                     
  - **Sample organizations analyzed:**
      - Small gym franchise
      - Retail pharmacy chain (CVS-like)
      - Technology startup
                           
### 3. Real Breach Analysis
                           
**Location:** `./TBD*-Breach-Analysis/`
                           
Analysis of real-world security breaches to derive lessons learned:
                           
- **Breach Overview** - Summary of the incident and timeline
- **Root Cause Analysis** - Investigation into how the breach occurred
- **Impact Assessment** - Effects on affected parties
- **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways and preventive measures
- **Recommendations** - Security improvements to prevent similar incidents
                                     
## Key Competencies Demonstrated
                                     
  - Security policy development and governance
  - Risk management frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)
  - Threat modeling and analysis
  - Vulnerability assessment methodologies
  - Business impact analysis
  - Compliance requirements understanding
  - Incident analysis and lessons learned
  - Stakeholder communication on risk and compliance

## Next Steps

  - Review the security policies to understand governance frameworks
  - Examine risk assessments to see vulnerability analysis methodology
  - Study breach analysis reports for incident analysis approaches
  - Consider how these practices apply to your organization
