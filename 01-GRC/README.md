# Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)

## Overview

This section demonstrates expertise in security governance, risk assessment, and compliance frameworks. Projects showcase practical applications of GRC principles including policy development, risk assessment methodologies, and analysis of real-world security breaches.

## Projects & Deliverables

### 1. Security Policies

**Location:** `./Policies/`

Comprehensive security policies developed for a sample organization to establish governance frameworks:

- **User Acceptance Policy** - Guidelines for acceptable use of company resources
- - **Security Logging Policy** - Standards for security event logging and retention
  - - **Additional Policies** - Data classification, incident response, access control, and more
   
    - **Key Elements:**
    - - Clear policy objectives and scope
      - - Roles and responsibilities
        - - Implementation requirements
          - - Compliance and enforcement mechanisms
           
            - ### 2. Risk Assessment
           
            - **Location:** `./Risk-Assessments/`
           
            - Risk assessment reports for hypothetical organizations demonstrating:
           
            - - **Asset Identification** - Inventory of organizational assets and their criticality
              - - **Threat Analysis** - Identification of potential threats and threat actors
                - - **Vulnerability Assessment** - Discovery of potential weaknesses
                  - - **Risk Calculation** - Quantitative and qualitative risk analysis
                    - - **Remediation Recommendations** - Prioritized mitigation strategies
                     
                      - Sample organizations analyzed:
                      - - Small gym franchise
                        - - Retail pharmacy chain (CVS-like)
                          - - Technology startup
                           
                            - ### 3. Real Breach Analysis
                           
                            - **Location:** `./Breach-Analysis/`
                           
                            - Analysis of real-world security breaches to derive lessons learned:
                           
                            - - **Breach Overview** - Summary of the incident and timeline
                              - - **Root Cause Analysis** - Investigation into how the breach occurred
                                - - **Impact Assessment** - Effects on affected parties
                                  - - **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways and preventive measures
